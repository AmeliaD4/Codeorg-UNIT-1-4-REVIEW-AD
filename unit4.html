       <b>Lesson 2: Variables Investigate</b>
       <h4>Check for understanding (C.F.U)</h4>
      <h5>Explain in your own words the process of creating and updating a variable. How does the Counter Pattern with Event work?</h5>
       <h6>A variable is created using the var code with the name of the variable coming next along with the string or number attached to said variable. the counter pattern with event makes it so that the variable only does it's function or displays itself when a certain input is put into the system, which then makes it interact with whatever's inside the =, and displays an output based on those two together. The variable is updated in this case with each click of the id.</h6>

      <b>Lesson 5: Conditionals Explore</b>
      <h4>Check for understanding (C.F.U)</h4>
      <h5>Can a computer evaluate an expression to something between true and false? Can you write an expression to deal with a "maybe" answer?</h5>
       <h6>a computer may be able to evaluate something between true or false, if it either gets an expression that's both true and false, or one that's neither. I might be able to, but it's probably a bit complex.</h6>

      <b>Lesson 6: Conditionals Investigate</b>
      <h4>Check for understanding (C.F.U)</h4>
      <h5>When creating an if-else-if statement you should always make your first condition the most specific. Write a short paragraph responding to the questions below.<br>
      What does it mean to put the most specific case first?
      Why is it important to put the most specific case first? What types of errors does it help avoid?</h5>
       <h6>You should put the most important if statement first, because if it's the most important, then it's more likely to be the one that takes priority. Like how scores are usually done where the top score takes priority over the lower scores because it should first check that. It helps avoid any errors with the code as th computer wo't scramble up responses from them being out of order. It's like a list.</h6>

       <h4>Check for understanding (C.F.U)</h4>
        <h5>In your own words describe the benefits of creating functions in your code?</h5>
         <h6>The benefits of creating functions in your code is that you ca call the function without needing to type out the entire thing over and over and clutter everything, it lets you find bugs easily because it's only the code defining the function that would have an issue, and it lets you save space along with keeping things organized.</h6>
