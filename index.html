<b>Unit Summaries</b>
<div class="wave" id="u1">
  <b>Unit 1</b>
<hr>
<p> In Unit 1, we were introduced to HTML, or Hypertext markup language. We learned how to use simple tags for making heading, paragraphs, lists, comments, and things like that. We made simple websites using HTML that sometimes would include images and links as well, along with debugging to check for errors in our code. We also learned how to use binary for on and off states (using bits and bytes). There were also overflow errors, which occurred when a byte could no longer make a new number and would end up bugging itself out. Later on in the Unit we were introduced to CSS, Cascading style sheets, which determined how a website would look rather than the structure or building of the website like HTML.</p>  
  <!--repeat code from 42 to 46 four times one per each unit-->

  <div class="wave" id="u2">
    <b>Unit 2</b>
  <hr>
  <p> In Unit 2, we learned about the internet and different components that worked together to keep it running. Like routers, Dns servers, protocols (which are used when exchanging data between devices), paths and bandwidths. Devices will usually try to use the fastest path available, to which they’ll send parts (packets) of the data through different routes to get to your destination of choice. There were also deeper things like Hypertext transfer protocol which is used for anything regarding sneding information and digital divide, a real world issue that affects some places in the world.</p>
</div>
  
  <div class="wave" id="u3">
    <b>Unit 3</b>
  <hr>
  <p> Within Unit 3, it was when we started to work on making apps, which also led to us learning about Javascript later in the unit. There’s different outputs that can happen when an onEvent is triggered by a specific input, and these are mostly activated by user inputs. In javascript, a string can either be letters or numbers. However letters require quotation marks, numbers don’t. There was also some expansion on what we could do using CSS. We learned what setproperty does, as well as a few examples using it in the app lab. This was also where we did pair programming, where there is a navigator and driver and the two work together while sometimes swapping to complete something at a singular workstation. It also allows you to have another pair of eyes on your work that can help you through steps.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="wave" id="u4">
    <b>Unit 4</b>
  <hr>
  <p>  Finally, in Unit 4, we were completly introduced to variables, conditionals, and functions. Variables can carry only one string in them at a time, called to assign by a var command. Variables can be globally used, or locally used, where they can only be called within that code area. Conditionals are used when it comes to Boolean values, where both relational operators and comparison operators are included to determine if something is true, or false. If statements are kind of like the official placement for where these are used, so that your program knows what to run or place depending on what answers as true or false. Pseudocode is simply writing out what your code would do in a more literal sense of sentences in most times a sequence, and is usually done outside of coding to have an idea of what would happen depending on the circumstances presented. There’s also functions, which allow someone to take the repeated part of their code and create an assigned name for it once, where it can then be called as many times as needed.
