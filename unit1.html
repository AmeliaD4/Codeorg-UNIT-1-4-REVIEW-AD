      <b>Lesson 1: Welcome to CSP</b>
      <h4>Check for understanding (C.F.U)</h4>
      <h5>What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to
        the ones that you just heard about from other students?</h5>
      <h6>I try to take notes on things that are important and review at home, so that I don't forget what I learned and
        can build upon it a bit by figuring out something new that adds onto what I learned somehow. It's kind of
        similar to taking notes to keep the mind from wandering and the making connections to what I already know &
        Learned today.</h6>

      <b>Lesson 2: Representing Information </b>
      <h4>Check for understanding (C.F.U)</h4>
      <h5>Recall when you built your information sending device. Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of
        two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options?</h5>
      <h6>It was probably to see if the devices we made already with two options could have more modified onto it even
        if it was originally meant for just two answers, like to build upon it after what it was originally made for.

      <b>Lesson 3: Circle Square Patterns</b>
      <h4>Check for understanding (C.F.U)</h4>
      <h5>How would you explain a number system to someone who had never seen numbers before?</h5>
      <h6>I would explain a number system as a pattern that has more added to it until it repeats, to which another
        place is added to continue that number system, or they change already existing things within the pattern to add
        more upon it without a new space.</h6>

      <b>Lesson 4: Binary Numbers</b>
      <h4>Check for understanding (C.F.U)</h4>
      <h5>1.Each time we add another bit, what happens to the amount of numbers we can make?<br>
        2.How many bits would be needed to count all of the students in class today?<br>
        3.What are the similarities and differences between the binary and decimal systems?</h5>
      <h6>1.The amount of numbers we can make is doubled each time.<br>
        2.Maybe 5 bits, since it has up to 32 different combinations.<br>
        3.Decimal systems go by 10's while binary goes by two's. for the doubling and going back by a place.</h6>

      <b>Lesson 5: Overflow and Rounding</b>
      <h4>Check for understanding (C.F.U)</h4>
      <h5>1.Modern car odometers can record up to a million miles driven. What happens to the odometer reading when a
        car drives beyond its maximum reading?<br>
        2.When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why not?
      </h5>
      <h6>1.The odometer resets, as it has to start over, I saw a video about it once and it did that. <br>
        2.It's not possible because all the possible fractions are endless in a sense, I believe due to the fact there's
        infinite numbers.</h6>

      <b>Lesson 7: Black and White Images</b>
      <h4>Check for understanding (C.F.U)</h4>
      <h5>Your computer science teacher asks you to sample a black and white image that is 4" x 6". How would you sample
        the image to provide a good digital approximation using the pixelation widget? What sample size would you use?
        How would your decision affect the digital representation?</h5>
      <h6>I would use a sampling size that allowed me to sample the image, maybe a higher one so i could get more space
        to sample wit, or just use a basic 32. The digital representation may be of lower quality or blurry.</h6>

      <b>Lesson 8: Color Images</b>
      <h4>Check for understanding (C.F.U)</h4>
      <h5>Describe how the process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to display a digital
        color image.</h5>
      <h6>I wasn't entirely here for the lesson but I believe it was the bigger sampling size meant the more rgbs had to
        be used for it in order for the numbers and such to show up, which the binary sequences show and form the image.

      <b>Lesson 9: Lossless Compression</b>
      <h4>Check for understanding (C.F.U)</h4>
      <h5>An author is preparing to send their book to a publisher as an email attachment. The file on their computer is
        1000 bytes. When they attach the file to their email, it shows as 750 bytes. The author gets very upset because
        they are concerned that part of their book has been deleted by the email provider.

        If you could talk to this author, how would you explain what is happening to their book?</h5>
      <h6>I would tell the author that a part of their book has not been deleted by the email provider, just that the
        file attachment has been compressed (or made smaller) to save space as it's sent to the publisher. The publisher
        will still see every part of the book just as the author wrote it.</h6>

      <b>Lesson 10: Lossy Compression</b>
      <h4>Check for understanding (C.F.U)</h4>
      <h5>You’ve been given a new cell phone with a 2 gigabyte data plan. You plan to use your phone for text messages,
        images, video, and music. Which of these categories are best compressed using lossless compression? Which of
        these categories are best compressed using lossy compression? Why?</h5>
      <h6>The text messages and music re best compressed as lossless compression as they usually aren't that big, while
        images and video are lossy so that the phone can save up space and better fit everything without taking up tooo
        much data.</h6>

      <b>Lesson 11: Intellectual Property</b>
      <h4>Check for understanding (C.F.U)</h4>
      <h5>Imagine you were using some of our pixelation tools to create an image and you posted it online for your
        friends to see - but, a week later you find out someone took that image and put it on a T-shirt that they’re
        selling for $10 each.<br>
        Now that we understand Copyright, what would need to change in order for the scenario from the warm-up to be
        okay?</h5>
      <h6>I would place my image under creative commons copyright, so the person would legally be able to distribute the
        t-shirts.</h6>

      <b>Lesson 12: Project Digital Information Dilemmas</b>
      <h4>Check for understanding (C.F.U)</h4>
      <h5>1.Many museums have digital catalogs of their collections. What are the potential benefits and harms of
        creating these digital catalogs?<br>
        2.Why should we care about information being represented digitally? How does this impact you personally?</h5>
      <h6>1.The benefits of creating a digital catalog are that it's easier to find what you're looking for, however
        this makes it easy for others to become confused on where to even start loooking for the things they want to
        see.<br>
        2.We should care about information being represented digitally because it can be used against others and may
        contain private information. I'm personally unaffected by it, mostly because I don't post online but there is a
        chance of my information being stolen since my mom posts about my birthday.</h6>
